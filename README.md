## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a simulation for the customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

In this project I will build different types or recommendation system to recommend offers to existing and new users (Rank based and collaborative filtering recommendation system).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Attached to this repo a notebook attached where you can find all analysis steps for the business questions we have.
The notebook is easy to navigate and I have added comments and markdown cells to make it even easier for the reader.
